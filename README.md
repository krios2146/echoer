## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:krios2146/echoer.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd echoer
```

Follow the instructions on the [Gleam website](https://gleam.run/getting-started/installing/) to install it

Installation of the Gleam can be quite tricky so there is a compiled escript file in the repo - `echoer`. To run this file you just need to install Erlang, no Gleam needed. After Erlang installation you can run

```bash
  ./echoer get PATH
```

If you install Gleam you can run 

```bash
  gleam run get PATH
```

That should display your PATH environment variable
